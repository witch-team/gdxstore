# gdxstore
A storage and version control tool for WITCH result files.

Installation: just add the `gdxstore/source` directory to your PATH.
Using the setup.py file would require using a virtual environment on HPC. 
I prefer to avoid this for now.

Then copy the configuration file to your WITCH installation folder. For example:

`cp config.ini-example ../witch/config.ini`

and replace `<your-username>`, or change the whole path if you prefer.
